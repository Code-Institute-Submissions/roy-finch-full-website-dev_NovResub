# Introuduction

This is the read new file for my unit four milestone project.  This project will present a website that has been developed using django, CSS, HTML and other languages.  For this units I must create a website that these develop completely using django and is the final units of the Code Institute's course.  Within this unit, I would like to create a web site that it is really easy to numerous and offers users and ability to easily manage and control their accounts and also be able to search for or buying products that they would like to purchase.  Within this project, I would like to have a web sites that begins to use interesting features but I have not tested in the previous units.  I would like to create a website that is visually appealing but also impressive to view.  Within this module is optional to use BootStrap but I will not use this as I would like more control of my CSS and my websites style.

I would like to begin this unit by identifying what users would like to see from my website.  I would like to understand what I need to include within my website so that users expectations are met.  I would also like to think about the purpose of my site along with what I want to do to provide my service to review a viewer.  I would also like to think about is the theme, layouts and design of the site and what I need to do to truly create and encapsulate my idea.

Within this site, I need to make sure that the website meets both my criteria and the criteria of the user/view.  I must keep in mind of what the user requires from a shopping sites.

One requirements of this module, is to include the script of JS which will perform alterations to the website either by changing the font or the font size for example. This must be able to take a response from the user to allow them to controll certain aspects of the website or webpage. I will try and impliment an ability for users to customise the website elements and give them a few options to make the site easier to read or understand. I will also allow for the setting options to possible be saved so that returning to the website will leave the site with the customisations previously applied by a user.

## Users Expectations
Within this section, I will discuss what different users would require from my website.  I need to think about the uses expectations and their needs whilst creating my website.  I need to think about users that are coming to my site for the first time, also need to think about users that are returning to my site or people who regularly shop on the website and also have an account within my site.

### First Time Users
+ Within a website, first time users would like to see a simple but effective web site layout and functionality.  We would like to be able to quickly and effectively understand website and have their needs met on the site.  
+ Some users would need asimple navigation that will allow them to control searches on the site, other users would need a website that explains to the user what the site is about.  The website needs to allow users to shop on the side with the ability to filter searches to present the user with what they are looking for.  
+ Some users would like the ability to click on an image or product to see more detail or to see a larger image.

### Returning Users
+ Returning users would need a straightforward way to search for the product if they know what they're looking for.
+ Users would return to the site if you are able to provide competative prices and also be able to present the website in the style that they would like to see.

### Users with Accounts and Regular 
+ Some users would like to easily login and out of account, whilst some people would like a simple and straightforward way of creating an account.
+ Some users would like the ability to recieve emails about discounts or an ability to get discounts from purchases.
+ Some users would like to alter how the website would look, and make sure that the website can keep the options that the user selects and be able to always return to the site with the selected settings. This could be done by saving it to an account as a sub section about settings and be present on the website by using the information inside of the data fields using JS.

### Users with needs
Users that have needs and requirements would need the ability to control the web site, this could be done by controlling the style, fonts or sizes of elements within the website.  I will think of a way of creating a footer on the website which can be used by the user to controll a series of aspects on the website.  These aspects could include alterations to the font, alterations to the images and the ability to turn off background images or colors.

I think that the websites me navigation sure the accessible no matter where the user is on the website, and that the navigation bar should be easily understood, annotated and explained to the user so they can affectively search for website.

Some users would like to have easy access to their accounts and their personal information, whilst others would like to easily shop within my website and purchase without alot of hassil.  Some users would like to see offers for clearances of items that have been reduced.  I would like to create a home page that presents to the user a few list of products, like suggestions depending on accounts activity, what's new and possibly items that are reduced.

Some users would like to be able to see whether an item has been added to the basket and would need a notification or indication of if the items in the basket. Some users would need to be shown that that action has been completed.

Allow the users to be able to see and control the quantity of a product, although that in this instance I would only allow for the user to add one item at a time as this is about buying consoles and games which are retro and wouldn't necessarily be bought in bulk.



The purpose of my site is to provide a service were a user or viewer can come to my site to purchase a form of goods.  Within this module the site must allow for user to be able to make an account, to add items to their basket's and to be able to search for and buy products.  The products I am thinking of using within the site are games as I am interested in games and old fashioned consoles.  I think that our website needs to be somewhat personal to the creator as they can connect with the idea and website closer and be able to truly build the image of the website and connect with what they want to see on the site.  As I am thinking of creating a website that allows for users to purchase games and consoles I have began to think about the name of the website.

## Initial Concept

Some of the names of this website are retro resales, classics n' cash, cash the classics and finally retro exchange.  With the names that I have created I didn't necessarily feel as though retro resales and classics n' cash felt like they weren't professional or effective names to choice for the site.  I settled for the name retro exchange as I felt that this name fits the website better.  I plan on allowing users to be able to purchase and sell products what will see how it goes later on in production.  Once I had thought of a name I then began to search for a font that suited the theme that I was going for.  I settled for a font named Segoe UI as this font looked like what I was going for.  I wanted a font that looked more the feeling and professional or also looked different when the styles replied like bold and italic styling.  I made the logo very simple and originally threw around the idea of putting yellow in the logo, but I noticed that the yellow colour was hard to identify with a white background.  Once I had noticed that yellow did not work as initially intended by the end and settle for a basic black colouring on the letter RX.  I had chosen for local RX as a simplified version of retro exchange and also chosen to title the site R-Exchange as the simplified version of the name.  Both of these decisions where to create a simplified mean for users to nickname the site and also wanted a simple and effective logo design.  I always begin our web sites by creating a logo and name and selecting a font as I believe these aspects as they are part of the core identity of the website.

Now that I have a name for my website a then begin to plan out the layout.  I think about what I want to present to the users at all times and what I want to include within the top navigation bar.  I understand that I would like to include a form of logo, the name of our web site, the searchbar or some way of finding the product and away to sign in or out and view the basket.  I then begin to develop the layout, working with what I want to include and were I want to include it.  I begin by creating a wire frame and think about how I want to lay out the homepage the logging in and signing up page and the product view page.  I would like to create two bars that contained the different bits of information that are fixed to the top and bottom of page.  For now I think I will settle with the signing in and signing up buttons in the bottom bar and the logo, the name, searchbar and baskets in the top bar.  I want to make sure that the user can access these bars no matter where they are on the website.  But when I begin to creates the mobile version of the site I may change the layout of the fixed bars.

I wanted to create the website where the navigation bar is created to how I want it to look like. I want to create the websites whole personality and make sure that the navigation bar is exactly how I want the site to be created. I want to allow a user to search for a product by name or to filter searches using three fields, console, what they want to see, for example consoles, games ect and by price, rating ect. These filters would allow for an ability to easily search the website.

On the home page I want to began to create the theme that will sit with the site and begin its theme that would begin to appear within the websites that are below the index. This is to make sure that the theme is consistant and runs thoughout all pages to make the website feel fullbodied and planned out well. Keeping a consistant theme allows for your site to work really well across the site and gives of a feel as though the theme is how you want the site to be seen. The personality of a website, in my opinion is defined by the theme, functionality, fonts ect, and what I have chosen I feel really encapsulates the website and give the user the ability to understand what the site is about and what the creator wants the site to look like.

## Wireframe

This is the wire frame for my website.  This is the first plan that I have created for my website, I have presented a wire frame that contains the drawn plans of my website.  When I create a website I oftenly draw it out on paper as drawing it is easier then created a wire frame.  I want to use this wire frame as a point of reference as this is the first rough copy of what I want my website to look like.  As my web site is developed, it will begin to differ from the wireframe and will be changed in ways that will suit the personality of the website better.  Their will be reasons behind changing some features of the wireframe as I begin to flesh out the website.  I don't think the websites should be created with out an ability to differ from the plans as time goes on.  The wireframe is good for creating the idea and foundation of what the site stands for, but is not how the website should look at the final version.

Within the website, there was a few things that I had changed which are different to the wireframe.  These changes came about when I began development.  I struggled to resonate with the idea of the site at the beginning.  I wanted to make sure that the navigation was created with an ideal perspective.  I did this because within a website where you can look for products the navigation is key.  Once I've got the navigation created to how I feel it should look then I began to create the contents with the site.  This means that some of the contents will have differed from the wireframe as once some of the features are changed so will other features.

When I compare the wireframe to the website, I will keep this in mind as the image of how I want the website to look has strayed far from of wireframe of the now.  Although the wireframe has given me a very good plan to base the website of.  Within the products page and the individual products page I have created the HTML close to the wireframe design.

I feel like the wireframe has really strengthened the web site's layout and functionally.  Although the website has differed from the wireframe, the websites design has been developed from the wireframes plan.

This is the URL for were the wireframe can be found.  The plan is rough but contains the website initial idea.
https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l2nBjuQ=/

Within some of the instances of the wireframe I have left them rather basic, as I am unsure of how I should structure them, as I understand that as time goes on the theme will change a lot. And I like to keep the pages with a consistant theme to make sure that they are structured and styled with a similar and respectable fashion. I want the whole project to be woven together at the end and all the styles and functions to be made perfectly.

## Testing

Originally I created the images and icon that I wanted to use on the site but I usually create a series of images that can possible be included but are never used as I feel they dont suit the instance of the website. Their is a few images that where created for the site but not used. Originally I wanted to not have text where the sign in and login links are instead I wanted icons but after checking how they looked I never continued with the idea as I just felt as through the text itself looks and feels well with the theme. Also the search button was to have an icon but I couldn't seem to style the icon to how I wanted it to be so I removed that from the website.

As I've gone through developing the website, I have noticed that there are quite a few features that I was torn between.  Although I had difficulty thinking about how I want the website to look.  I feel as though the final design is quite true to how I want the website to work and look.  I really like how it has been going and I feel as though I have presented the true idea of Retro Exchange.

I feel as though my website is very user friendly, and does not over complicates what I feel a user would like to see.

I have had two attempts at the css. Originally whilst trying to get the feel for the site I was using a very specific model class css, which would alter the individual items with specific css styles, which can make it hard to reuse or alter your css on other objects on the site. When creating the second css, I had managed to create a more universal css which had less of a specific model style and allowed for easier styling and less css. When creating a more versitile css it is easier to code with and also allows for a small and effective css file as you can set simple features like center-text which can be applied to any object. Whilst if you had customised each specific model and gave them this characterist then the code would become longer as you have to insert this into each model class, whilst if you make your own css model class you can easily just add this to the class of each object youd like to give the property too.

I wanted a website that can be navigated in a some what easier fashion. Although my website can be seen as hard to navigate within the site I wanted to make it easier to update and add more information too. I couldn't simply do this to the website if I had indiviual a tags and a drop down as the same issue would arrise with my site as it does with similar sites like cex, which has a navigation that has become overly dragged out due to constantly adding to the site. Whilst this simple and effective filter system maybe seen as complicated, in my opinion this makes everything easier to do. The website will look more versitile in my opinion. Added to the site would be as easy as just adding new information to the datasets. on the base.html

When creating the basket it was hard to work out what structure I needed to use for the basket, I settled for the list, dictionary combination so that the data can be accessed by the html easier and more linear, than if it was a dictionary. This also makes it easier to use within some of the views when updating the basket and other instance. Its just originally I tried to use a multi-dictionary which did overcomplicate things and create a few issues within the views and sites.

Navigation was on my mind, as I want something that is layed out for the user but doesn't take more space on the users screen. I already had the basket fixed to the screen and thought if I had added the search bar and filters to the screen it would have over complicated the matter, and as its an app you can purchase products on it makes some sense that the user can always be able to checkout. This does raise, a little issue about proper navigation on the site, but a search bar and a filter system in my opinion can easily allow a user to find what they want.

I always like to create a basic but effective layout on my websites, I like to have information in a cascade of sorts so that the user is kind of given a pathway through the website. I always like to make sure that the navigation bar is placed at the top to create and work with the normality of what a user expects from a site. They dont neccessarily enjoy a site that has a confusing layout and overtime users have began to create a stereotypical layout that they are accustom to when using the internet to look for a product they want to look for.

Within creating the toast messages they would display within some instances with the basket contents, so originally I had set a boolean variable to have a value that would be used to display the basket "short" view to make it easier to see that the product has been added to the basket. Now the styling has altered this is not a feature of the website and has been removed from the site.

I create each of the views, products, basket and checkout with a view of the basket so that the user can see their basket at mostly all times. I have an add products view on the products page, an add or remove products from the basket, and the short view of the checkout to just see what the user is purchasing. I feel as though this simple stlye of the products is really simple but looks really nice as though they are info cards with corrisponding information inserted into them so the user can understand what they need to understand.

From the original version of the site I have always added the 10% shipping to the products, but within later development I reaslied I needed to add this simple message that the user can see what just states that the value is increased by the 10% to make sure that they understand that shipping is seperate.

Changed where the location of the search bar was as it was effectively impeding on the other elements that I wanted on the top bar. So once the style file was not working and I changed to bootstrap I also changed the layout slightly by moving the search bar into the filter box above the filters form. I have also added text to annotate the two options of navigation to explain what they are and what they do along with a margin to give them space so they dont become to crowded.

I always like for the index page to contain information about the website. Originally the layout idea that I had was to show a range of products that the user can see a preview of but I chose to not settle for this as I feel as through the homepage shouldn't be as overly complicated and just allow for the user to read a bit about the site and jump into the products page, using a button.

No matter what styling I was going to apply I wanted the filters and apply button to have there own line if the views width became to small. I wanted this to be the case as the user can't choose the filters within a confind space so I made the filters seperate on smaller screens but stuck with the original layout for larger screens as that is orginally how I wanted the site to look.

## Deployment

Within the instance of depolying the website, I had to restyle the website using bootstrap but was not able to alter the style of the generated forms, as they are harder to style.

Within deployment I ran into several issues, one being that my static files where not being loaded on the server, specifically the css files and the js for the checkout seems to load fine. So within this instance, I had to decide to alter my styling and import bootstrap and go back on the original idea of just using my own css. This isn't a bad thing, as bootstrap offers a lot of useful features within the site. Its just some more overlook properties will be abcent from the bootstrap style. I noticed that the website wasn't neccessarily far from the original idea of the website once completly styled in bootstrap and some of the functionality was lost on the site, like scroll bars on the toast.success file ect. But this just makes my site easier to use as my concept of placing the basket fixed on the bottom right/left of the users window, can become rather intrucive and now that the toast messages dont neccessarily overly intrude on the users space, it makes it easier to user. Also had to remove the logo as this was impact the top-bars layout. Once the style had to be altered, I have also removed the background image from the website.

Within deployment the entire website was using the aws for the images perfectly fine but the aws or server where not obtaining the css styling sheets. Other than that the deployment went fine.

I have set the heroku deployment to not collect static, and also I have set the database to be a heroku database.

I am very proud of the final product and thing that even through the style has become rather difficult to apply, I would say that at the least the website looks and feels as I want it too.

Within revisiting the wireframes I realised that the data-layout of the products didn't really make sense if I didn't include the rating of the product on the actual page. As that would make that data redundant, so after seeing that I have added it onto the products page and the details page.

Also after revising to wireframes I have chosen to reuse the assets for the buttons that would be used to access your account, login, signout ect. Within the top bar I have made it so that the buttons are the assets that I originally made for the website. Reusing these assets as allowed for me to be able to fit all the buttons on the top bar without having to alter the scaling of the topbar and it works within smaller sizes of the website.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__001.PNG "Overview of the entire wireframe")
This is an overview of how the pages will be layed out and how they will interact with each. Within this wireframe I had originally planned for the style and pages to be layed out in a similar but effective difference to the actual end product.

Within this wireframe layout I have the Home page able to access the sign in, log in and the products view or products page. As this is the index I want the user to be able to access any pages about accounts and products from this page.

From this the products page and the product view you can add the product and add it to the basket and then from the basket view you can finally checkout with the products you have selected.

Within the login page or signup page you can create or access your account and then have a slightly altered page footer, where the login and signup changes to logout and my account. Within this instance you can access your account and be able to check your order history and/or update the billing details.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__002.PNG "Home page wireframe")
Within the home page there is a ton of differences that can be spotted from a quick overlook.
I wanted it to have a similar layout to Cex as this site would be a form of competition for the Cex website. I originally wanted the products to be on the home page, and have some ability to be personalised and have some products like, most viewed, or highest rated products. There are a few features that I didn't add at the end as this would have not felt right with the new and current theme. I wanted the products to change if the user had an account and have some way of tracking the users history but I didn't want to create a strongly overwhelming home page and wanted a very gental homepage that would greet the user and not be filled with tons of different tabs and posts about products.

The similar layout with the search bar, logo in one of the versions, before restyling with boostrap. I have also added the filter system to the website which originally I never intended to have but I wanted a simply way to navigate the site but not have tons of buttons everywhere.
Also the location of the basket has been changed as I wanted the basket to have its own location at the bottom of the site somewhere and change the login a tags with the basket location on the wireframe. I see on sites they always have this layout and wanted to change it up by having a basket accessable at all instances. I have still also got the information about the site on this wireframe which I did add to the final product. The questions and answers may differ but the layout and idea is still consistant.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__003.PNG "View an individual item")
This was the original idea for the indiviual products view, it was basic but I felt as through it had to have a lot of place holders for the information I may include as originally I was unsure of it being a website about games and consoles and through that I could have done a cloths brand. Now as I have more material to work with on the website, I was able to add and flesh the product page more and be able to some what have this style. Originally in a different draft it had the same layout, but within this new instance of the site I have made it so that the items are cascading. I have not added the ability to save a product and show the rating as the website doesn't contain a lot of products and as this site is enough for moderation but not being used in a practical instance the website would be given more information but for the current time it has the layout that it has and uses some of the features from the original wireframe. If the website was for a functional use a lot more of things would be added to allow for an easier way for the user to find a product like a save or favourite function but as of now, I dont see a necessarity for this function as its not got tons of products and is not in a practical instance.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__004.PNG "Products page")
The products wireframe is pretty much consistant to the design and has not been altered much to the original design.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__005.PNG "Basket and Checkout page")
The basket contents page and the checkouit page and pretty much the same as the final product. I wanted the user to adjust there basket before proceeding to checkout and then they can see the products in a small view and then fill the payment and card details form and finalize the payment.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__006.PNG "Signup and login wireframes")
These are the exact same as the final product and have the just some styling differences which where not presented within the wireframe as the structure and the idea is what I like to encapsulate within the wireframe. Overplanning can restrict the inspiration of the mind.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__007.PNG "Signed in home page")
As the layout has massively changed on the index page the buttons have already been discued and have changed to the final product. The My Account button and signout are swapped with the basket.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__008.PNG "Account wireframe")
The profile contains the information from the wireframe on the final product and is just styled to suit the theme of the website.

Within the comparison of the wireframes and the final product, the website only has extensive changes to the base.html. The rest of the site contains the same amount of information and has a similar layout other than the products individual page which doesn't contain the rating and the save function.

I went through the website and checkout the html, css and js, against a validator, there where a few issues at first. Originally buttons where used to create the style on the buttons on the website for the purpose of navigating the website, but the validator said that the use of a button being within an a tag is incorrect, so I had to change the button behaviour and remove the a tags. I added an onclick function to the buttons so that they begin to move the user to different locations on the website. Also I forgot to include an alternative text property to my images so the images where flagged by the validator and I have added this now so the validation has returned a pass on each of the url links.

I have also noticed an error with the admin find products page, and have added an if statement to catch fatal errors. What is happening is the admin can click on find product button and submit the form without choosing an item. But I had not set this up to work, so it would return an error. Now I have the views.py reading for the user to click new product or just press the button and now both inputs return a new add products form so that the admin user can update the website and add a new product.

I have managed to fix the stripe payment api on the checkout system. I believe this is due to gitpod but I have noticed that the stripe.PaymentIntent.modify can not be done within the instance that I am doing it. This looks to be down to two possible issues. Either stripe deals with inputs through the urls and has a url for modifications and uploading data and a url for just checking the data. Then due to the way I am doing this I am trying to send the information to stripe and it keeps returning a failure as it may test the general url before testing the upload url.

To fix this I have made it so that the cache_data url now just retrieves the information using the pid.
