# Introuduction

This is the read new file for my unit four milestone project.  This project will present a website that has been developed using django, CSS, HTML and other languages.  For this units I must create a website that these develop completely using django and is the final units of the Code Institute's course.  Within this unit, I would like to create a web site that it is really easy to numerous and offers users and ability to easily manage and control their accounts and also be able to search for or buying products that they would like to purchase.  Within this project, I would like to have a web sites that begins to use interesting features but I have not tested in the previous units.  I would like to create a website that is visually appealing but also impressive to view.  Within this module is optional to use BootStrap but I will not use this as I would like more control of my CSS and my websites style.

I would like to begin this unit by identifying what users would like to see from my website.  I would like to understand what I need to include within my website so that users expectations are met.  I would also like to think about the purpose of my site along with what I want to do to provide my service to review a viewer.  I would also like to think about is the theme, layouts and design of the site and what I need to do to truly create and encapsulate my idea.

Within this site, I need to make sure that the website meets both my criteria and the criteria of the user/view.  I must keep in mind of what the user requires from a shopping sites.

One requirements of this module, is to include the script of JS which will perform alterations to the website either by changing the font or the font size for example. This must be able to take a response from the user to allow them to controll certain aspects of the website or webpage. I will try and impliment an ability for users to customise the website elements and give them a few options to make the site easier to read or understand. I will also allow for the setting options to possible be saved so that returning to the website will leave the site with the customisations previously applied by a user.

## Users Expectations
Within this section, I will discuss what different users would require from my website.  I need to think about the users expectations and their needs whilst creating my website.  I need to think about users that are coming to my site for the first time, also need to think about users that are returning to my site or people who regularly shop on the website and also have an account within my site.

+ Within a website, first time users would like to see a simple but effective web site layout and functionality. They would like to be able to quickly and effectively understand website and have their needs met on the site.
+ Some users that are new to a site need a navigation that they can understand, this can be done by creating simple and in the face navigation systems for the user. This can be done by a series of a tags or buttons within the top of the website which allow for quick searching on the site.
+ Some other types of users would like the ability to search the website for a paticular product and/or filter the website for the right product they may require. This would allow some users to be able to get a list of products depending on their paticular inputs.
+ Some users require a place where the user can go to learn about the website and be able to effectively search for information that they can use to find out what your site is and be able to find out about your site.
+ Some users would like the ability to find a product and click on it for more information, a larger image and some more information like rating so they can find information about a product so they can be sure about the purchase.
+ Easy layout of the products page can effectively allow for a better visual space for the user. For example, less products on each line makes it easier to read and allows for a user to get through your products list with a decent speed and not be overwhelmed with a series of products. This also allows for the products to be easier to understand as each product is given more space to be viewed by the user.
+ An ability to create an account to make the transaction and checkout system easier for a user either for the first time or for a future time.
+ A way for a user to check their accounts order history or to see what they have purchased previously.
+ A user would like an email invoice to provide them the information about a transaction, so they can double check information they have provided and be able to go over a purchase afterwards.

## Initial Concept
Some of the names of this website are retro resales, classics n' cash, cash the classics and finally retro exchange.  With the names that I have created I didn't necessarily feel as though retro resales and classics n' cash felt like they weren't professional or effective names to choice for the site.  I settled for the name retro exchange as I felt that this name fits the website better.  I plan on allowing users to be able to purchase and sell products what will see how it goes later on in production.  Once I had thought of a name I then began to search for a font that suited the theme that I was going for.  I settled for a font named Segoe UI as this font looked like what I was going for.  I wanted a font that looked more the feeling and professional or also looked different when the styles replied like bold and italic styling.  I made the logo very simple and originally threw around the idea of putting yellow in the logo, but I noticed that the yellow colour was hard to identify with a white background.  Once I had noticed that yellow did not work as initially intended by the end and settle for a basic black colouring on the letter RX.  I had chosen for local RX as a simplified version of retro exchange and also chosen to title the site R-Exchange as the simplified version of the name.  Both of these decisions where to create a simplified mean for users to nickname the site and also wanted a simple and effective logo design.  I always begin our web sites by creating a logo and name and selecting a font as I believe these aspects as they are part of the core identity of the website.

Now that I have a name for my website a then begin to plan out the layout.  I think about what I want to present to the users at all times and what I want to include within the top navigation bar.  I understand that I would like to include a form of logo, the name of our web site, the searchbar or some way of finding the product and away to sign in or out and view the basket.  I then begin to develop the layout, working with what I want to include and were I want to include it.  I begin by creating a wire frame and think about how I want to lay out the homepage the logging in and signing up page and the product view page.  I would like to create two bars that contained the different bits of information that are fixed to the top and bottom of page.  For now I think I will settle with the signing in and signing up buttons in the bottom bar and the logo, the name, searchbar and baskets in the top bar.  I want to make sure that the user can access these bars no matter where they are on the website.  But when I begin to creates the mobile version of the site I may change the layout of the fixed bars.

I wanted to create the website where the navigation bar is created to suit the look of the site. I want to create the websites whole personality and make sure that the navigation bar is exactly how I want the site to be created. I want to allow a user to search for a product by name or to filter searches using three fields, console, what they want to see, for example consoles, games ect and by price, rating ect. These filters would allow for an ability to easily search the website.

Using the homepage I will be able to better understand the theme and style that I want to go for when creating the website, as the home page is the page that greats the user first. This is to make sure that the theme is consistant and runs thoughout all pages to make the website feel fullbodied and planned out well. Keeping a consistant theme allows for your site to work really well across the site and gives of a feel as though the theme is how you want the site to be seen. The personality of a website, in my opinion is defined by the theme, functionality, fonts ect, and what I have chosen I feel really encapsulates the website and give the user the ability to understand what the site is about and what the creator wants the site to look like.

## Planning

This is the wire frame for my website.  This is the first plan that I have created for my website, I have presented a wire frame that contains the drawn plans of my website.  When I create a website I oftenly draw it out on paper as drawing it is easier then created a wire frame.  I want to use this wire frame as a point of reference as this is the first rough copy of what I want my website to look like.  As my web site is developed, it will begin to differ from the wireframe and will be changed in ways that will suit the personality of the website better.  Their will be reasons behind changing some features of the wireframe as I begin to flesh out the website.  I don't think the websites should be created with out an ability to differ from the plans as time goes on.  The wireframe is good for creating the idea and foundation of what the site stands for, but is not how the website should look at the final version.

Within the website, there was a few things that I had changed which are different to the wireframe.  These changes came about when I began development.  I struggled to resonate with the idea of the site at the beginning.  I wanted to make sure that the navigation was created with an ideal perspective.  I did this because within a website where you can look for products the navigation is key.  Once I've got the navigation created to how I feel it should look then I began to create the contents with the site.  This means that some of the contents will have differed from the wireframe as once some of the features are changed so will other features.

When I compare the wireframe to the website, I will keep this in mind as the image of how I want the website to look has strayed far from of wireframe of the now.  Although the wireframe has given me a very good plan to base the website of.  Within the products page and the individual products page I have created the HTML close to the wireframe design.

I feel like the wireframe has really strengthened the web site's layout and functionally.  Although the website has differed from the wireframe, the websites design has been developed from the wireframes plan.

This is the URL for were the wireframe can be found.  The plan is rough but contains the website initial idea.
https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l2nBjuQ=/

Within some of the instances of the wireframe I have left them rather basic, as I am unsure of how I should structure them, as I understand that as time goes on the theme will change a lot. And I like to keep the pages with a consistant theme to make sure that they are structured and styled with a similar and respectable fashion. I want the whole project to be woven together at the end and all the styles and functions to be made perfectly.

## Development
I began by creating the website and slowly worked to create the theme and style of the website. Once I understood what I wanted the site to look like then I began to think of how I want the users to navigate the website. I originally wanted the site to just be a basic search and filter system and began by creating this functionality to the website. Once that was done I had added a section on the index page where the user is able to find information that will help them better understand the website and be able to learn about the site and what service we provide. I also added a quick button to take the user to the products page so they can see all the products within the store.

I wanted to create this little theme where the products and information are like in a style like a card, so its an image and then corrisponding data. This was also to help with displaying a large quantity of products to the user. I want to make sure that the user can effectively see each product but not have a cramped and over clustered visual space. I gave them a style to suit the website and then allowed the user to be able to click roughly anywhere within the card to find out more information. This takes the users to a products page. This functionality is a consistant feature and a user can always get more information and a larger picture of the product. Within these two pages they have some basic information like the name, price and the rating.

Once the user has selected the items they want they can click on the basket which is accessable on most pages, originally the basket would always displayed but I made it so it can only displayed in specific pages. Once they go onto the basket they can edit the basket just before they finish up and click checkout. This is set up so that the user can see information like the quantity, shipping and be able to remove the product if it is incorrect.

Once they are ready they can go onto the checkout page and be able to finalize the transaction and purchase the products. I layed out the page so its a simplified list of the products and then a form so that the user can give the personal information so that the order is complete. I make the form within all of the sites large and easily readable with decent space for the ability for a clear and effective use by the user.

I also made it so they can save their information on an account if they have one, and the information they provide can be reused for the next transaction. I also have added the ability to look at previous purchases and check their order history, with the information that was given at the time of the purchase.

If the user is an admin or super user they can also be able to access a simple page where they can find a product and then be able to either add a new one or edit existing products. This allows for the user to be able to easily alter information about the products without having to go into the django-admin service.

I have realised that after creating this structure and functionality I realised that the website is missing a location where the user is told that the device will be added with a 10% shipping cost so I added a label at the top to be able to show the user how much a product may actually cost. I felt as though it was rather stinge to not give them this information at first hand. Now the site looks more professional and doesn't sneak in extra costs.

I then realised that the navigation system was not easily understood and annotate the navigation system with some basic information like search by word or filter. This was to try and make my site easier to understand so that a users doesn't have to learn how to user the site and the website shows the users what they need to do to find products.

The products data json file has been given a relevant name and effectiveness so that it works within my website for the purpose I need.
[
    {
	   "pk":1,
	   "model":"products.product",
	   "fields":{
		  "sku":"re000000000001",
		  "name":"Boxed Black Nintendo 64 Console",
		  "price":110.0,
		  "console":1,
		  "category":1,
		  "rating":3.5,
		  "description":"The Nintendo 64 console was created as a console that will allow for a person to play a game with more of an engaged 3D enviroment. This console has got many games that use this 3D enviroment and is a wonderful and enjoyable console. This came after the SNES and it was when a game was created for the SNES they realised the potential of creating a console that allowed for the 3D enviroment.",
		  "image_url":"",
		  "image":"b_box_n_64.jpg"
	   }
	}
]

The pk is the product key which is needed by the django services, and then model type, and then any corrisponding fields that are used by my websites.

Within the fields I have the product information like name, sku, price, console, category, rating, description, image_url, image.

Within console and category they are stored as numerical values which reference the specific values of the actual category information on the corrisponding .json files. Image, is the name of the file, and the image_url is residue from a pervious idea of what I was going to do with the website.

Rest of the information is for the users to beter help them with the decision of their purchase.

[
    {
        "pk": 1,
            "model":"products.console",
            "fields": {
                "name": "n64",
                "display_name": "Nintendo 64"
            }   
    }
]

This is the layout of the console json data file, similar to categories as its another type of categories to better identify the product. This is used to be able to search by the filter of a product. This is the same on categories and is used in the same effective manor.

[
    {
		"pk": 1,
		"model":"products.category",
		"fields": {
			"name": "consoles",
			"display_name": "Consoles"
		}
	}
]

These are the way the information is stored and accessed on the website.

When creating the basket I originally wanted it to be a dictionary, but had to create a dictionary list, so that it can store information in a dictionary style but be accessed by the django template language in a list format. This allows for the user to be displayed the products without any issues.

[
   {
      "pk":"2",
      "quantity":1,
      "product":{
         "id":2,
         "name":"Black Nintendo 64 Console",
         "sku":"re000000000002",
         "console":1,
         "category":1,
         "description":"The Nintendo 64 console was created as a console that will allow for a person to play a game with more of an engaged 3D enviroment. This console has got many games that use this 3D enviroment and is a wonderful and enjoyable console. This came after the SNES and it was when a game was created for the SNES they realised the potential of creating a console that allowed for the 3D enviroment.",
         "image_url":"",
         "price":70.0,
         "rating":3.5,
         "image":"b_n_64.jpg"
      },
      "shipping":7.0,
      "total_cost":77.0
   }
]

This is how the basket is stored and accessed. The products are added to stored within the basket variable and then the values of the actual product are added to it afterwards from a different function. The same function will add and remove an item from the basket and is used within different files like products as its imported into the view.py.

## Testing
Originally I wanted to include a series of icons on the website, but didn't manage to get them to work with the theme of the site, so I had to remove them to make the site look and work better. Their is a few images that where created for the site but not used. Originally I wanted to not have text where the sign in and login links are instead I wanted icons but after checking how they looked I never continued with the idea as I just felt as through the text itself looks and feels well with the theme. Also the search button was to have an icon but I couldn't seem to style the icon to how I wanted it to be so I removed that from the website.

I have worked on the css file and changed it twice. I wanted to take the old css, and make it more robust and allow for the class functions to be able to be reused more. I was finding it hard to create the website and wanted to make sure that the css could be versatile so I updated it and changed some of the classes so they did less of an effective that wasn't true to the naming convention of the class. For example, half border container, would just do a gently margin, padding, and a circle container on the top half. Instead of suiting the one instance its used. It means that the css was able to be reused over the entire site.

After testing the stripe api I managed to fix the issue that I was struggling with and that was the modification that was being done by the cache_data function in the views.py after changing this to a retrieve I made it so that the payment would have to go through stripe and then be able to be retrieved before the user can begin to be taken to a different page or be able to finalise the transaction. After fixing the payment api I have managed to reach one of the users expectations by allowing them to chose a product and be able to pay for it using the stripe api on the checkout page.

After this I had made sure that the admin was displaying the order correctly and originally the amount of money in the shipping, grand total ect, where not being updated this was before I realized that I needed to add an ability for the signals.py to be used by the app.py during loading, and added the correct code to allow for this to be updated.

The original way I was creating and accessing the basket was not giving other functions the right information about the product, and originally the basket would displayed the items correctly but within the use of the basket on the checkout page and toasts message, it would not include the images. This was done by added the entire model class to the basket so that it can displayed anywhere and the information can be used wherever I needd to user it.

The way the website has been made is so the user has access over what is within their basket and has the ability to add or remove a product, they are unable to add and remove large quantities of products from the basket but I felt this helped with the style and felt right as the products on this site are something that someone would come and purchase one of.

During testing I had changed the location of the search bar so that it is in the same div container as the filter, so that the ways to search the site are together as they are a choice on how to travel the site, and dont work together to navigate and you are either effectively searching using the filters or the search. Whilst earlier it didn't feel as though I was showing the user that they can do eiter of them and not both. I wanted to make it so the search bar is for people who know what they want and filtering is to try and make it easier to find what you want. This was also done to prevent the top bar from becoming overcrowded and cluttered creating a more visually pleasing website.

To allow for the style to look better on smaller devices I worked on creating a different style for smaller screens to make it easier to be accessed on smaller devices depending on what device the user is using to access the page. I had increased the size of all the buttons and interactable locations on the site and also made it so key search features are made to fit within specific sections of the site.

I have chosen to make it so that on a larger screen less products are displayed and the screen is not visual distruptive and the user has the ability to look at what is offered on the site but not become overwhelmed with the large amount of information within a small confined space.

To increase the visual space the user has within the website, I have made the basket smaller, but decent sizes so it can still be clicked and not got the navigation bars fixed to the stop of the screen so that the user is able to use the site without too much interference from other items on the screen. The basket is now located so that the user can be able to access buttons easier no matter the screen size and can be added to the basket.

Within creating the toast messages they would display within some instances with the basket contents, so originally I had set a boolean variable to have a value that would be used to display the basket "short" view to make it easier to see that the product has been added to the basket. Now the styling has altered this is not a feature of the website and has been removed from the site.

I have added a series of buttons that do allow for a simple way of navigating the site at a click of a button to help the user be able to navigate the website more effectively. Also made it so that during development a user can add another button incase they want to add more products and create ways to navigate to those products.

I have made it so the website meets the requirements of the user and allows them to complete what they would like to do with the site.

I have given the user three ways of navigation so they can easily find the products that they are looking for.

I have also allowed for the user to be able to find produdcts on the website and can checkout with the products that they have found and also use an account to make checking out easier as they can save their information and this can be used on the checkout page to give the user a completed form.

I have also added the ability for a user to look on an account to find person information and also previous orders, so they can get any relevant information from those orders, or just view them on their accounts page.

I have worked to create a good style that is addaptable to smaller devices and allows for users to be able to access the site no matter what device they may need. As I have tested this website, I feel as though the buttons on the sight are rather smaller and need to be made larger, also, I feel as though the new navigation buttons need to have a larger text size so they can be seen on medium devices. I have increased the padding of the buttons so they are easier to click, and also changed the way the product "cards" are displayed on small devices so that it can be decently sized and the basket can not effect the clickability. Whilst the user is on the products page, I have made sure that the basket div container doesn't overlap or effect the visual space and clickable space for the user to be able to use the site as intended. Also to improve the websites multi platform support I have increased the size of the account link icons to make it easier to access the users account. This now allows for a user to be able to use the website on different devices and not be unable to use the site.

## Deployment
I began to deploy the site to heroku, disabled the collection of static files and hosted them on aws.amazons service and used a heroku database for some of the databases that are used on the site. As I began to do this I realised that the website began to become a little unstable.

I had noticed that my css for the website wouldn't load along with the images, I had managed to get the images working but noticed that after trying to get the css file to load I began to convert the style of the website into a bootstrap css style so that the files can be obtained from boostrap and as I am rather familiar with this language I was able to begin to convert the website with quite an effective time. Whilst doing this a series of original features where changed out and some of the previous ideas where able to become useful within the site. So I was unable to create a dropdown menu for the different functions like login, signup ect. So I began on trying to create a way to show this with the icons I originally developed at the beginning of the development and had noticed these little icons had effectively become helpful in creating a straight forward navigation bar that was a series of small little icons instead of a dropdown menu. Another issue that I had was the way that the logo and top bar where layed out, this become rather difficult to work out and lead to the removal of the logo image from the top bar and was done to make it easier to be able to change the layout on smaller screens.

I had an issue with translating the css to boostrap but managed to get the theme to fit within this language difference, it isn't as sharp using the bootstrap language as the language in my opinion has a rather soft styling to the website.

After changing the css to boostrap I also removed the toast littl view of the basket as it was not displayed in a wa that I felt was right for the site, and took up more of the visual space and didn't disappear after the toast message was displayed now it will display the message at the bottom of the screen behind the basket div.

I always like to make sure that the website has a cascade effect on the content that is within the webpage as I feel this makes it eaier to follow and you have a kind of control of where the users visual process is going so that you can take them through the site and lead them where you want to go.

The admin style was missing from the aws.amazon service so that the admin site was not working correctly which I have altered and added the css so that the admin url works and can be visually pleasing to the admins.

I noticed that the admin can originally create an error when adding a product if they just click the button but now they can just add new product by clicking the button and fixed the error that was created.

Originally I had a rather difficult time adding the stripe payment api to the website and had a series of issues to work out with this whilst doing the deployment.

To fix this I have made it so that the cache_data url now just retrieves the information using the pid. I have tested the codes that where given on stripe and it seems to have fixed the website as the user can only use the main 4242 code to pass the stripe payment system and the other stripe card codes return a comment about insufficient funds. So it looks like the payment system cannot be abused by a user that is being rathe mischievious with the payment of a product on the site.

Within the checking out system, I had an issue where the checkout wouldn't work for if the user has not got an account. I have managed to fix this by checking if the user has an account and then update the order with the users account information if applied. I hav also caught an error in the programming by making it so that the save order information also has the same catch to check if the user has an account or not.

To make it easier to develop within the future I have externalised the navbar, topbar and the search div. I feel as though making these files external will make it easier to edit and won't need to be effected on the base.html of the allauth too much.

## Reviewing Final Product

Within revisiting the wireframes I realised that the data-layout of the products didn't really make sense if I didn't include the rating of the product on the actual page. As that would make that data redundant, so after seeing that I have added it onto the products page and the details page.

Also after revising to wireframes I have chosen to reuse the assets for the buttons that would be used to access your account, login, signout ect. Within the top bar I have made it so that the buttons are the assets that I originally made for the website. Reusing these assets as allowed for me to be able to fit all the buttons on the top bar without having to alter the scaling of the topbar and it works within smaller sizes of the website.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__001.PNG "Overview of the entire wireframe")
This is an overview of how the pages will be layed out and how they will interact with each. Within this wireframe I had originally planned for the style and pages to be layed out in a similar but effective difference to the actual end product.

Within this wireframe layout I have the Home page able to access the sign in, log in and the products view or products page. As this is the index I want the user to be able to access any pages about accounts and products from this page.

From this the products page and the product view you can add the product and add it to the basket and then from the basket view you can finally checkout with the products you have selected.

Within the login page or signup page you can create or access your account and then have a slightly altered page footer, where the login and signup changes to logout and my account. Within this instance you can access your account and be able to check your order history and/or update the billing details.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__002.PNG "Home page wireframe")
Within the home page there is a ton of differences that can be spotted from a quick overlook.
I wanted it to have a similar layout to Cex as this site would be a form of competition for the Cex website. I originally wanted the products to be on the home page, and have some ability to be personalised and have some products like, most viewed, or highest rated products. There are a few features that I didn't add at the end as this would have not felt right with the new and current theme. I wanted the products to change if the user had an account and have some way of tracking the users history but I didn't want to create a strongly overwhelming home page and wanted a very gental homepage that would greet the user and not be filled with tons of different tabs and posts about products.

The similar layout with the search bar, logo in one of the versions, before restyling with boostrap. I have also added the filter system to the website which originally I never intended to have but I wanted a simply way to navigate the site but not have tons of buttons everywhere.
Also the location of the basket has been changed as I wanted the basket to have its own location at the bottom of the site somewhere and change the login a tags with the basket location on the wireframe. I see on sites they always have this layout and wanted to change it up by having a basket accessable at all instances. I have still also got the information about the site on this wireframe which I did add to the final product. The questions and answers may differ but the layout and idea is still consistant.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__003.PNG "View an individual item")
This was the original idea for the indiviual products view, it was basic but I felt as through it had to have a lot of place holders for the information I may include as originally I was unsure of it being a website about games and consoles and through that I could have done a cloths brand. Now as I have more material to work with on the website, I was able to add and flesh the product page more and be able to some what have this style. Originally in a different draft it had the same layout, but within this new instance of the site I have made it so that the items are cascading. I have not added the ability to save a product and show the rating as the website doesn't contain a lot of products and as this site is enough for moderation but not being used in a practical instance the website would be given more information but for the current time it has the layout that it has and uses some of the features from the original wireframe. If the website was for a functional use a lot more of things would be added to allow for an easier way for the user to find a product like a save or favourite function but as of now, I dont see a necessarity for this function as its not got tons of products and is not in a practical instance.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__004.PNG "Products page")
The products wireframe is pretty much consistant to the design and has not been altered much to the original design. There was one feature that didn't make it into the site at the end and that was the abiltiy to favourite or heart a product for later. I felt as though this would have helped the user being able to buy or look for a product for a future purchase but left the idea out. You can also see the heart-icon in the media file what was doing to be used within the site.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__005.PNG "Basket and Checkout page")
The basket contents page and the checkouit page and pretty much the same as the final product. I wanted the user to adjust there basket before proceeding to checkout and then they can see the products in a small view and then fill the payment and card details form and finalize the payment.

These are the exact same as the final product and have the just some styling differences which where not presented within the wireframe as the structure and the idea is what I like to encapsulate within the wireframe. Overplanning can restrict the inspiration of the mind.

![Wireframe](/media/wireframe__007.PNG "Signed in home page")
As the layout has massively changed on the index page the buttons have already been discued and have changed to the final product. The My Account button and signout are swapped with the basket.

The profile contains the information from the wireframe on the final product and is just styled to suit the theme of the website.

Within the comparison of the wireframes and the final product, the website only has extensive changes to the base.html. The rest of the site contains the same amount of information and has a similar layout other than the products individual page which doesn't contain the rating and the save function.

## Validation and Feedback
I went through the website and checkout the html, css and js, against a validator using the w3c validator on the internet and used its ability to validate a website using the url, which I used the url of the deployed version of the site on heroku.

I had noticed that the validation had flagged mainly two things which where the fact that the buttons where inside an a tag and that was given back as an error and I fixed this by adding just the button and an onclick function to take the user to a url that I needed to take them too. I felt as though the theme of black and white was so effective at showing the site how I wanted it to be seen and understood that the buttons where effectively part of the theme so I tested the theme with a tags but they didn't work like the buttons do. They can be sized and altered to create the theme but miss functionality so I wanted them to be able to be clicked and have a large visual space but the a tag was not clickable within the styled space so I returned to the buttons and themed them as needed. The other main issue was the fact that I had not given images within the site an alt value so I began to give each image this value and had to remove the function of several rating stars appearing to present the user with a visual of how much they have been rated.

I was also given feedback about the way my site uses the navigation and was told that it isn't able to suit all users, so I added a series of buttons that would navigate the user to corrisponding locations on the website to make a quick and effective search at the click of the button, I had also realised that this would help suit some uses who are unable to search by the use of a filter, search function.
